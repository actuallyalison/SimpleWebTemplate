<p>When I decided to go to Granny's house I could have no inkling of what was truly in store for me.
This is a tale of heartbreak and woe, of hope and despair and miraculous rebirth. It began,
as stories often do, at the beginning. I was just playing out back when my mother suddenly
appeared with a basket of bread and stuff and told me I had to take it to my grandma's 
house. I really didn't want to go so I snuck around back and hid in the bushes and ate 
all the treats and threw the basket in the river. Then I spent a lovely afternoon playing
by the creek, and then pretended to return home via the path to my grandma's. It's not
like my mom and her mom ever talk, ya know. Otherwise she wouldn't be making me schlep
the treats over to her house. She would go over herself and have tea like a normal adult. Sheesh!</p>
