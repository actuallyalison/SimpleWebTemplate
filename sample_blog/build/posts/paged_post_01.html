<h3>how to avoid wearing out your scroll button</h3>
<h3>Chapter 1 (continued)</h3>
<p>Once there was a scroll button who was very tired because stories were so long that he
was always having to get spun by people and it made him dizzy. He didn't mind it so much
but he had always really wanted to write a novel and it wasn't easy to keep his concentration
when he was getting whirled around all the time, so one day he hatched a plan to write a
templating engine that would help him make multipage blog entries without needing to duplicate
the menus a bazillion times or resort to having a backend written in insecure PHP.</p>
