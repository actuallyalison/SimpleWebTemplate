<h3>Beardies</h3>
<p>When I decided to get a bearded dragon I had no idea what I was getting into. 
A growing bearded dragon can eat up to thirty crickets a day, or the equivalent 
in tropical dubia roaches. They need carefully tuned temperature and some humidity 
control, and very specific and expensive lighting as well as vitamin supplements 
to stay healthy. However, they are highly charming and engaging pets.</p>
